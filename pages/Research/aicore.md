# Core AI Algorithm Developments

We will focus on several theory and algorithmic questions to develop core AI capabilities that will have significant translational impact. These directions include developing robust and interpretable machine learning (ML) algorithms, multi-modal fusion, domain knowledge accommodation, semi-/unsupervised/reinforcement learning.
