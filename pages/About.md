The Translational AI Center will break down ``disciplinary silos`` to bring together core Iowa State artificial intelligence researchers and subject matter experts interested in applying new technologies to their work. The center will initially focus on conducting core artificial intelligence research, as well as pursuing five application areas of artificial intelligence:

1. Materials design and manufacturing;
2. Biology, healthcare, and quality of life;
3. Autonomy, intelligent transportation, and smart infrastructure;
4. Food, energy, and water; and
5. Ethics, fairness, and adoption.

In addition to serving as a scientific hub for translational artificial intelligence, the center will organize research seminars, host workshops, training, and on-boarding programs, offer seed funding for research projects, and serve as an intermediary between private industry partners seeking research services and appropriate university faculty. See below the members of Translational AI Center.
