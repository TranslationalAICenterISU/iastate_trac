# TrAC Workshop on Scientific Machine Learning: Foundations and Applications -- April 22-23, 2022

[TrAC @ Iowa State University](/)Â  is organizing a technical workshop on Scientific Machine Learning: Foundations and Applications on **April 22-23, 2022**. 

## About This Workshop:
This workshop seeks to bring together top experts from areas of scientific machine learning to discuss progress that has been made on scientific machine learning research, and to identify promising avenues where theory is possible and useful. There will be several invited talks each day, a poster session and spotlight talks by young researchers. This meeting will expose participants to some of the main current trends and recently developed tools in scientific machine learning research and applications. The workshop will be for one and a half-day meeting comprising of 2 plenary talks, 6 invited talks, a poster session and a session on lightning talks.

## Submissions:
We invite your contributions in any of the following (and related) topics:
- New theory and fundamentals of scientific machine learning
- Applications of scientific machine learning to Translational AI
- Development of software, libraries, or benchmark datasets
- Identification of key challenges and opportunities for future research

**One-page extended abstract (in PDF)** should be submitted by **April 1, 2022 (23:59, CST)** to [this link](mailto:SciML_2.s4q69if80l49ckgz@u.box.com). The abstract will be peer-reviewed and selected for a lightning talk and/or a poster presentation.
