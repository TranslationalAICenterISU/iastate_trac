# TrAC Training on Intro to Cloud-based Deep Learning

The [TrAC @ Iowa State University](/) along with [CyVerse.org](https://www.cyverse.org/) will host a day long hybrid workshop on Introduction to Cloud-based Deep Learning. This workshop will introduce you to concepts in cloud, containerization, and GPU computing with Python. We will demonstrate a simple deep learning application problem using public research cyberinfrastructure with version control systems and containerization.

## Agenda 

Intro Workshop Days are at the following times:

 1. **Part 1** 10:00–13:00  US Central Daylight Time (11:00–14:00 US Eastern Daylight Time)
 2. **Part 2** 14:00–17:00  US Central Daylight Time (15:00–18:00 US Eastern Daylight Time)

Work Cloud Natively with CyVerse & Jetstream-2

**All times shown in Central Daylight Time**
