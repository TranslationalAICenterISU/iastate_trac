Dan Nettleton,dan.jpg,https://www.stat.iastate.edu/people/dan-nettleton,dnett@iastate.edu,"Dan Nettleton is the Laurence H. Baker Endowed Chair, Distinguished Professor, and Chair of the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University. Dan also serves as Director of the Laurence H. Baker Center for Bioinformatics and Biological Statistics. Nettleton conducts research on statistical methods for the design and analysis of high-dimensional biological datasets. Example data types include transcriptomic data from microarrays or RNA-sequencing, microbiome data, genomic data for use in genome-wide association studies, and data on complex phenotypes. Since joining Iowa State University in 2000, Nettleton's work has been heavily influenced by numerous collaborations with leading plant and animal scientists who seek to understand the functions of genes in biological systems and to learn how genotype and environment interact to shape important phenotypes.",Statistics
Janette Thompson,janette.jpg,https://www.enscigrad.iastate.edu/people/janette-thompson,jrrt@iastate.edu,"Janette is Morrill Professor at Natural Resource Ecology and Management Department. Her current research integrates biophysical, social, and economic aspects of natural resource management and land use change, primarily in urban landscapes. She uses a variety of quantitative and qualitative research tools to understand human perceptions of and interaction with natural resources in urban environments. She also conduct research examining biophysical relationships between land use, plant community composition, water quality, and habitat conditions of streams, under current and predicted climate scenarios. She is also involved in research using statistical modeling to predict risk of woody plant invasiveness.",Natural Resource Ecology & Management
